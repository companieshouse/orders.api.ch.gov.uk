## Terraform ECS

### What does this code do?

The code present in this repository is used to define and deploy a dockerised container in AWS ECS.
This is done by calling a [module](https://github.com/companieshouse/terraform-modules/tree/main/aws/ecs) from terraform-modules. Application specific attributes are injected and the service is then deployed using Terraform via the CICD platform 'Concourse'.


Application specific attributes | Value                                | Description
:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------
**ECS Cluster**        | order-service                                     | ECS cluster (stack) the service belongs to
**Load balancer**      | {env}-chs-apichgovuk <br> {env}-chs-apichgovuk-private                                 | The load balancer that sits in front of the service
**Concourse pipeline**     |[Pipeline link](https://ci-platform.companieshouse.gov.uk/teams/team-development/pipelines/orders.api.ch.gov.uk) <br> [Pipeline code](https://github.com/companieshouse/ci-pipelines/blob/master/pipelines/ssplatform/team-development/orders.api.ch.gov.uk)                                  | Concourse pipeline link in shared services
